# react-native-scroller

Four-way scrolling ScrollView for react-native.

I built this primarily for use on android devices where it only allows horizontal or vertical scrolling at one time, see [discussing here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2962)

See `JxScrollerView.js` for example.
