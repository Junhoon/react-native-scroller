# react-native-scroller

Four-way scrolling Scroller View for react-native.

Primarily built for Android devices for that currently it only allows scrolling horizontally or vertically at one time, see [discussing here](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/2962) for details.

See `JxScrollerView.js` for example.
